# Change: Migrate Email Module requirements into OpenSpec

## Why
We need the Email Module behavior captured in OpenSpec so it can serve as the source of truth and guide implementation.

## What Changes
- Add Email Module requirements and scenarios as OpenSpec deltas
- Capture the current intent from the legacy V2 architecture doc

## Impact
- Affected specs: email
- Affected code: none (documentation only)
