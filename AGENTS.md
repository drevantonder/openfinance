# AGENTS.md

## Project

Open-source modular personal finance app focused on simple, human money tracking.
Use pnpm workspaces for package management.

## Docs Workflow

See `docs/AGENTS.md` for change workflow and spec format.
Read `docs/project.md` for project context.
Read `docs/TESTING.md` for the test bar and commands.

## Audience & Language

Apply these rules whenever you write copy, names, or specs.

- **User-facing copy** (UI strings, feature lists, onboarding, README intro): use family-friendly, everyday money words; keep it short and human; avoid finance/enterprise jargon.
- **Developer docs/specs**: be concise and precise; still avoid enterprise tone; prefer the same everyday terms users see so internal names don’t drift (e.g. avoid “ledger,” use “expenses/income/budget”).
- **README**: start with a friendly, practical overview + features; get more technical in later sections (self-hosting, contributing, security, dev setup).
