# Change: Add expected expenses module

## Why
People need a clear, simple way to plan regular bills and one-off savings without mixing them into income setup.

## What Changes
- Introduce expected expense targets with amounts and categories.
- Add recurring and once-off target schedules with no carryover.
- Add a settings section to create, update, and delete targets.
- Expose read-only target exports for other modules.
- Treat savings targets as once-off expected expenses with a target date.
