# Change: Migrate Activity Module requirements

## Why
We need the Activity Module behavior captured in our docs so it can serve as the source of truth and guide implementation.

## What Changes
- Add Activity Module requirements and scenarios as spec deltas
- Capture the current intent from the legacy V2 architecture doc
