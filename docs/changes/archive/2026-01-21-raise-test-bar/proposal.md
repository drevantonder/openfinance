# Change: Raise test bar

## Why
We want fewer regressions and clearer expectations before implementation work scales.

## What Changes
- Define a higher test bar and coverage target for work in this repo.
- Clarify when lint/test/build runs are expected for changes.
- Add expectations for UI smoke flows as they become available.
