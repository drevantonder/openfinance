# Change: Core system

## Why
We need a shared shell so sign-in, navigation, and settings feel consistent while modules plug in cleanly.

## What Changes
- Add a core shell with sign-in, dashboard, and settings access.
- Add module registry and config toggles for loading modules.
- Define navigation patterns for desktop and mobile with module entries.
- Provide shared settings sections plus a module variables store.
- Allow modules to supply dashboard widgets.
